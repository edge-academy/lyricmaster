The paranoia is in bloom, the P-R

Transmissions will resume

They'll try to push drugs

Keep us all dumbed down and hope that

We will never see the truth around

(So come on!)



Another promise, another scene,

Another package lie to keep us trapped in greed

With all the green belts wrapped around our minds

And endless red tape to keep the truth confined

(So come on!)



They will not force us

They will stop degrading us

They will not control us

We will be victorious



Interchanging mind control

Come let the revolution take its toll if you could

Flick a switch and open your third eye, you'd see that

We should never be afraid to die

(So come on!)



Rise up and take the power back, it's time that

The fat cats had a heart attack, you know that

Their time is coming to an end

We have to unify and watch our flag ascend

(So come on!)



They will not force us

They will stop degrading us

They will not control us

We will be victorious



Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Hey, hey, hey, hey!



They will not force us

They will stop degrading us

They will not control us

We will be victorious



Hey, hey, hey, hey




I know you've suffered

But I don't want you to hide

It's cold and loveless

I won't let you be denied



Soothing

I'll make you feel pure

Trust me

You can be sure



I want to reconcile the violence in your heart

I want to recognize your beauty is not just a mask

I want to exorcise the demons from your past

I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart



You trick your lovers

That you're wicked and divine

You may be a sinner

But your innocence is mine



Please me

Show me how it's done

Tease me

You are the one



I want to reconcile the violence in your heart

I want to recognize your beauty is not just a mask

I want to exorcise the demons from your past

I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart



Please me

Show me how it's done

Trust me

You are the one



I want to reconcile the violence in your heart

I want to recognize your beauty is not just a mask

I want to exorcise the demons from your past

I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart


Far away 

The ship is taking me far away 

Far away from the memories 

Of the people who care if I live or die 



The starlight 

I will be chasing a starlight 

Until the end of my life 

I don't know if it's worth it anymore 



Hold you in my arms 

I just wanted to hold 

You in my arms 



My life 

You electrify my life 

Let's conspire to ignite 

All the souls that would die just to feel alive 



Now I'll never let you go 

If you promised not to fade away 

Never fade away 



Our hopes and expectations 

Black holes and revelations 

Our hopes and expectations 

Black holes and revelations 



Hold you in my arms 

I just wanted to hold 

You in my arms 



Far away 

The ship is taking me far away 

Far away from the memories 

Of the people who care if I live or die 



And I'll never let you go 

If you promise not to fade away 

Never fade away 



Our hopes and expectations 

Black holes and revelations 

Our hopes and expectations 

Black holes and revelations 



Hold you in my arms 

I just wanted to hold

You in my arms

I just wanted to 


It's bugging me

Grating me

And twisting me around



Yeah I'm endlessly

Caving in

And turning inside out



Because I want it now

I want it now

Give me your heart and your soul

And I'm breaking out

I'm breaking out

Last chance to lose control



Yeah it's holding me

Morphing me

And forcing me to strive



To be endlessly

Caving in

And dreaming I'm alive



Because I want it now

I want it now

Give me your heart and your soul

I'm not breaking down

I'm breaking out

Lace chance to lose control



And I want you now

I want you now

I feel my heart implode

And I'm breaking out

Escaping now

Feeling my faith erode

won't stand in your way

Let your hatred grow

And she'll scream

And she'll shout

And she'll pray

And she had a name

Yeah she had a name 



And I won't hold you back

Let your anger rise

And we'll fly

And we'll fall

And we'll burn

No one will recall 

No one will recall



This is the last time I'll abandon you

And this is the last time I'll forget you

I wish I could



Look to the stars

Let hope burn in your eyes

And we'll love

And we'll hope

And we'll die

All to no avail

All to no avail



This is the last time I'll abandon you

And this is the last time I'll forget you

I wish I could 



This is the last time I'll abandon you

And this is the last time I'll forget you

I wish I could
