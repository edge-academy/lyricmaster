Puttin my defences up

'Cause I dont wanna fall in love

If I ever did that, I think Id have a heart attack



Never put my love out on the line

Never said yes to the right guy

Never had trouble getting what I want

But when it comes to you, Im never good enough

When I dont care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll

Wont wash my hair, then make 'em bounce like a basketball



But you make me wanna act like a girl

Paint my nails and wear high heels, yes you

Make me so nervous, that I just cant hold your hand



You make me glow, 

But I cover up, wont let it show, 

So Im puttin my defenses up

'Cause I dont wanna fall in love

If I ever did that, I think Id have a heart attack 

I think Id have a heart attack 

I think Id have a heart attack 



Never break a sweat for the other guys

When you come around, I get paralyzed

And every time I try to be myself

It comes out wrong like a cry for help

Its just not fair

Pains more trouble than love is worth

I gasp for air

It feels so good, but you know it hurts



But you make me wanna act like a girl

Paint my nails and wear perfume, for you, 

Make me so nervous, that I just cant hold your hand



You make me glow, 

But I cover up, wont let it show, 

So Im puttin my defenses up

'Cause I dont wanna fall in love

If I ever did that, I think Id have a heart attack 

I think Id have a heart attack 

I think Id have a heart attack 



The feelings got lost in my lungs

Theyre burning, Id rather be numb

And theres no one else to blame

So scared I take off and I run

Im flying too close to the sun

And I burst into flames



You make me glow, 

But I cover up, wont let it show, 

So Im puttin my defenses up

'Cause I dont wanna fall in love

If I ever did that, I think Id have a heart attack 

I think Id have a heart attack (Heart attack)

I think Id have a heart attack

I think Id have a heart attack



I think Id have a heart attack


You wanna play, you wanna stay, you wanna have it all

You started messing with my head until I hit a wall

Maybe I shoulda known, maybe I shoulda known

That you would walk, you would walk out the door



Hey!



Said we were done, you met someone and rubbed it in my face

Cut to the punch, she broke your heart, and then she ran away

I guess you shoulda known, I guess you shoulda known

That I would talk, I would talk



But even if the stars and moon collide

I never want you back into my life

You can take your words and all your lies

Oh oh oh I really don't care

Even if the stars and moon collide

I never want you back into my life

You can take your words and all your lies

Oh oh oh I really don't care

Oh oh oh I really don't care



I can't believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you

You don't deserve to know the way I used to think about you

Oh no not anymore, oh no not anymore

You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go



Now if we meet out on the street I wont be running scared

I'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air

And make you understand, and make you understand

You had your chance, had your chance



But even if the stars and moon collide

I never want you back into my life

You can take your words and all your lies

Oh oh oh I really don't care

But even if the stars and moon collide

I never want you back into my life

You can take your words and all your lies

Oh oh oh I really don't care

Oh oh oh I really don't care



Yeah, listen up

Hey, hey never look back, dumb struck boy, ego attack

Look boy, why you so mad

Second gets in, but shoulda hit that

Hey Demi you picked the wrong lover

Shoulda picked that one is cuter than the other

I just wanna laugh, cause you tryna be a hipster

Kick it to the curb, take a polaroid picture



But even if the stars and moon collide

I never want you back into my life

You can take your words and all your lies

Oh oh oh I really don't care

Even if the stars and moon collide

I never want you back into my life

You can take your words and all your lies

Oh oh oh I really don't care

Oh oh oh I really don't care


Skies are crying, I am watching

Catching teardrops in my hands

Only silence, as it's ending

Like we never had a chance

Do you have to make me feel like

There's nothing left of me?



You can take everything I have

You can break everything I am

Like I'm made of glass

Like I'm made of paper

Go on and try to tear me down

I will be rising from the ground

Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper



As the smoke clears, I awaken

And untangle you from me

Would it make you, feel better

To watch me while I bleed?

All my windows still are broken

But I'm standing on my feet



You can take everything I have

You can break everything I am

Like I'm made of glass

Like I'm made of paper

Go on and try to tear me down

I will be rising from the ground

Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper



Go run, run, run

I'm gonna stay right here, 

Watch you disappear

Yeah-oh, go run, run, run

Yeah, it's a long way down

But I am closer to the clouds up here



You can take everything I have

You can break everything I am

Like I'm made of glass

Like I'm made of paper, oh-oh

Go on and try to tear me down

I will be rising from the ground



Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper

(Like a skyscraper)

Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper

am confident, but

I still have my moments.

Baby, that's just me.



I'm not a supermodel

I still eat McDonald's.

Baby, that's just me.



[Chorus]

Well, some may say I need to be afraid

Of losing everything.

Because of where I

Had my start and,

Where I made my name.

But everything's the same

In a la la land machine. Machine.



Who said I can't wear my

Converse with my dress?

Oh, baby, that's just me!



And who said I can't be single

I have to go out and mingle

Baby, that's not me.

No, no.



[Chorus]



Tell me do you feel the way I feel

Cause nothing else is real

In the la-la land appeal.



[Chorus]



Well, I'm not gonna change

In a la la land machine

Well I will stay the same

In la la land



Machine



I won't change anything of my life

(I won't change anything of my life)

I'm staying myself tonight

(I'm staying myself tonight


Don't walk away like you always do

This time

Baby you're the only thing that's been

On my mind

Ever since you left I've been a mess

(You won't answer your phone)

I'll say it once and I'll leave you alone

But I gotta let you know



[Chorus]

I wanna get back

To the old days

When the phone would ring

And I knew it was you

I wanna talk back

And get yelled at

Fight for nothing

Like we used to

Oh, kiss me

Like you mean it

Like you miss me

Cause I know you do

I wanna get back

Get back

With you



Don't look at me that way

I see it in your

Eyes

Don't worry about me

I've been

Fine

I'm not gonna lie

I've been a mess

Since you left

And every time I see you

It gets more and more intense



[Chorus]



You were the only one I wanted

And you were the first one I fell for

You're the only one that im in need of

And I don't want to be lonely anymore



[Chorus]



(Get back)

Get back

(Get back)

Get back

(Get back)

Get back

(Get back)

Get back



Oh, kiss me

Like you mean it

Like you miss me

Cause I know that you do

I wanna get back

Get back

I wanna get back

Get back

I wanna get back

Get back

Get back

Yeah
