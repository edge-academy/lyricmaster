never loved nobody fully

Always one foot on the ground

And by protecting my heart truly

I got lost in the sounds

I hear in my mind

All these voices

I hear in my mind

All of these words

I hear in mind

All this music

And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart

Well, it breaks my heart



Suppose I never ever met you

Suppose we never fell in love

Suppose I never ever let you

Kiss me so sweet and so soft

Suppose I never ever saw you

Suppose you never ever called

Suppose I kept on singing love songs

Just to break my own fall

Just to break my fall

Just to break my fall

Just to break my fall

Break my fall

Break my fall



All my friends say

That of course it's

Gonna get better

Gonna get better

Better

Better

Better

Better

Better

Better

Better



I never loved nobody fully

Always one foot on the ground

And by protecting my heart truly

I got lost in the sounds

I hear in my mind

All of these voices

I hear in my mind

All of these words

I hear in mind

All this music

And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart

I hear in my mind

All of these voices

I hear in my mind

All of these words

I hear in my mind

All of this music

And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart

Breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart



You are my sweetest downfall

I loved you first, I loved you first

Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth

I have to go, I have to go

Your hair was long when we first met



Samson went back to bed

Not much hair left on his head

He ate a slice of wonder bread, and went right back to bed

And history books forgot about us and the Bible didn't mention us

And the Bible didn't mention us, not even once



You are my sweetest downfall

I loved you first, I loved you first

Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads

But they're just old light, they're just old light

Your hair was long when we first met



Samson came to my bed

Told me that my hair was red

Told me I was beautiful, and came into my bed

Oh, I cut his hair myself one night

A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light

And he told me that I'd done alright

And kissed me till the mornin' light, the mornin' light

And he kissed me till the mornin' light



Samson went back to bed

Not much hair left on his head

Ate a slice of wonder bread, and went right back to bed

Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down

Yeah, we couldn't destroy a single one

And history books forgot about us

And the Bible didn't mention us, not even once



You are my sweetest downfall

I loved you first



This is how it works

It feels a little worse

Than when we drove our hearse

Right through that screaming crowd

While laughing up a storm

Until we were just bone

Until it got so warm

That none of us could sleep

And all the Styrofoam

Began to melt away

We tried to find some worms

To aid in the decay

But none of them were home

Inside their catacomb

A million ancient bees

Began to sting our knees

While we were on our knees

Praying that disease

Would leave the ones we love

And never come again



On the radio

We heard November Rain

That solo's really long

But it's a pretty song

We listened to it twice

'Cause the DJ was asleep



This is how it works

You're young until you're not

You love until you don't

You try until you can't

You laugh until you cry

You cry until you laugh

And everyone must breathe

Until their dying breath



No, this is how it works

You peer inside yourself

You take the things you like

And try to love the things you took

And then you take that love you made

And stick it into some

Someone else's heart

Pumping someone else's blood

And walking arm in arm

You hope it don't get harmed

But even if it does

You'll just do it all again



And on the radio

You hear November Rain

That solo's awful long

But it's a good refrain

You listen to it twice

'Cause the DJ is asleep

On the radio

(Oh, oh, oh)

On the radio

On the radio, uh oh

On the radio, uh oh

On the radio, uh oh

On the radio


They made a statue of us

Then put it on a mountain top



The tourists come and stare at us

Blow bubbles with their gum

Take photographs of fun, have/of fun



They'll name a city after us

And later say it's all our fault

Then they'll give us a talking to

Then they'll give us a talking to

Cause they've got years of experience



Living in a den of thieves

Rummaging for answers in the pages

Living in a den of thieves

And its contagious

And its contagious

And its contagious

And its contagious



We wear our scarves just like a noose

But not cause we want eternal sleep



And though our parts are slightly used

New ones are slave labor you can keep



Living in a den of thieves

Rummaging for answers in the pages

Living in a den of thieves

And its contagious

And its contagious

And its contagious

And its contagious



They made a statue of us

They made a statue of us

The tourists come and stare at us

The sculptors mama sends regards

They made a statue of us

They made a statue of us

Our noses have begun to rust



Living in a den of thieves

Rummaging for answers in the pages

Living in a den of thieves

And its contagious

And its contagious

And its contagious

And its contagious


If I kiss you where it's sore

Will you feel better, better, better?

Will you feel anything at all?

Will you feel better, better, better?

Will you feel anything at all?



Born like sisters to this world

In a town where blood ties are only blood

If you never say your name out loud to anyone

They can never ever call you by it



If I kiss you where it's sore

If I kiss you where it's sore

Will you feel better, better, better?

Will you feel anything at all?

Will you feel better, better, better?

Will you feel anything at all?



You're getting sadder, getting sadder, getting sadder, getting sadder

And I don't understand, and I don't understand

But if I kiss you where it's sore

If I kiss you where it's sore

Will you feel better, better, better?

Will you feel anything at all?

Will you feel better, better, better?

Will you feel anything at all

Will you feel anything at all

Anything at all?

Will you feel anything at all

Anything at all?

Will you feel anything at all

Anything at all?

Will you feel anything at all

Anything at all?

Will you feel anything at all
